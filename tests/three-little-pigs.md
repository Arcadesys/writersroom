Once upon a dawn, three little pigs left their mother's snug burrow to build homes of their own.
Practical Penny stacked straw in a sunny meadow because she craved quick comfort.
Brisk Benny lashed sticks beside a brook, trusting the chatter of water over the whisper of caution.
Careful Clara hauled bricks up a hill, humming a patient rhythm with every sturdy layer.
A hungry wolf prowled the road, his breath sharp as frost and his smile sharp as rumor.
He huffed at Penny's straw cottage, swirling the meadow into a golden storm until the walls tumbled.
Benny's stick lodge rattled like bones in the wind before the wolf's roar shattered it to splinters.
Clara opened her brick door, welcomed her trembling siblings, and faced the wolf with a calm stare.
The wolf's gusts broke against the brick house like waves on a cliff, and exhaustion drained his menace.
Together the pigs brewed turnip stew, sharing slow laughter that warmed the wolf into a weary truce.
